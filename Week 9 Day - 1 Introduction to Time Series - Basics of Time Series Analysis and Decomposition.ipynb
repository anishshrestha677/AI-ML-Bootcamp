    "- Seasonality (S): The repeating short-term cycles within the data. Seasonal patterns occur at regular intervals and are influenced by factors like time of year or holiday seasons. For instance, ice cream sales may increase during summer months.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cyclicality (C): Similar to seasonality, but cycles do not necessarily repeat at regular intervals. Cyclic patterns occur due to business cycles, economic factors, or other external influences.<br><br>\n",
